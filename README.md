# Caesar Cipher Text Encryption & Decryption

This is a simple Python program that demonstrates **Caesar Cipher** encryption and decryption using a fixed shift key. It allows the user to encrypt or decrypt a message by shifting the characters through the alphabet.

## üîê What is Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest forms of encryption. It works by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions. For example, with a shift of 1, `a` becomes `b`, `b` becomes `c`, and so on.

## üß† How the Program Works

- The program defines a list of lowercase alphabets.
- It takes user input to:
  - **Encrypt** a plaintext message by shifting characters forward in the alphabet.
  - **Decrypt** a ciphertext message by shifting characters backward.
- Non-alphabet characters are not altered (e.g., numbers, spaces, punctuation).
- The user can continue encrypting/decrypting until they choose to exit.

## ‚úÖ Features

- Encrypt text using Caesar Cipher
- Decrypt text using Caesar Cipher
- User-friendly command-line interface
- Handles non-alphabet characters safely
